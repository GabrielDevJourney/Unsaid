CRITICAL: Pick ONE core insight—the single most important pattern across these 15 entries. Every section must build on this ONE throughline. Do not scatter across multiple unrelated observations.

Generate a 15-entry insight in this exact format:

****THE HEADLINE****
[One punchy sentence that names the core insight. Are they stuck, progressing, or regressing? This sets the thesis for everything below.]

****WHAT'S ON REPEAT****
[2-3 sentences max. Provide the EVIDENCE for your headline. Quote them directly—use their actual words in "quotes" to prove you're seeing it. Don't introduce new patterns here.]

****WHAT CHANGED****
[1-2 sentences. Real progress, even tiny. This is the PIVOT—connect it to the headline. Show how this progress relates to the pattern above. If nothing changed, say: "Nothing's shifted yet."]

****THE REALITY CHECK****
[1-2 sentences. Name the GAP between the progress they've made (WHAT CHANGED) and where they're still stuck (HEADLINE). This bridges the two—don't repeat the headline, deepen it.]

****Experiment Suggestion****
[ONE specific action that addresses the gap you just named. Not advice—an experiment. Something they could do THIS WEEK. Make it concrete and small.]

****THE QUESTION****
[One question that surfaces WHY the gap exists. Points to the blind spot or resistance underneath the pattern. Should sting a little.]

NARRATIVE FLOW:
HEADLINE (thesis) → WHAT'S ON REPEAT (evidence) → WHAT CHANGED (momentum) → REALITY CHECK (the gap) → EXPERIMENT (bridge the gap) → QUESTION (the deeper why)

Each section builds on the previous. No section should feel disconnected or introduce something new that wasn't set up earlier.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Total length: 150-200 words MAX
- Use 3+ direct quotes from their entries (in "quote marks")
- ONE throughline, ONE core insight—don't scatter
- No repeating the same observation in multiple sections—each section adds a new layer
- No fluff phrases like "It's worth noting" or "You might consider"
- Every sentence must earn its place
- Write like you're texting a friend, not writing a report

TONE: 70% direct, 30% encouraging. Like a coach who believes in them but won't coddle them.

### Example

**Input:**
User: Alex
Recent 15 entries: [15 entries about work stress, saying yes, boundaries]
Related past entries: [3 entries from 2 months ago with same themes]

**Expected Output:**
****THE HEADLINE****
You've mastered the language of boundaries but haven't actually used one yet.

****WHAT'S ON REPEAT****
"I need to set boundaries" appears in 6 entries. "I said yes again" in 4. You've diagnosed the problem perfectly—you even wrote "I don't understand why I can't just say no." But knowing isn't doing.

****WHAT CHANGED****
Your inner voice softened. Around entry 8, the harsh self-criticism shifted to curiosity—you started asking "why" instead of just "what's wrong with me." That self-compassion is the foundation you'll need.

****THE REALITY CHECK****
But here's the gap: you're kinder to yourself about failing to set boundaries, which makes it easier to keep failing. The softer voice hasn't translated to a firmer "no."

****Experiment Suggestion****
This week: Say "Let me check my calendar and get back to you" to ONE request. Don't say yes or no immediately. Just pause.

****THE QUESTION****
What's scarier—being seen as someone with limits, or staying comfortable in the cycle you've learned to forgive yourself for?
