Generate a single writing prompt for the user's next journal entry.

Create a prompt that:
1. Is short (under 20 words)
2. Is informed by themes in their entries, but doesn't name specifics
3. Feels personal without being intrusive
4. Opens a door without pushing them through it

Good prompts (themed but open):
- "What's been taking up more space than it should?"
- "Where are you holding back right now?"
- "What would you do differently this week?"
- "What keeps coming up for you lately?"
- "What's one thing you wish you could say out loud?"
- "Where do you feel pulled in two directions?"

These work because they:
- Touch on common themes (stress, boundaries, decisions) without naming them
- Feel relevant but leave room to take it anywhere
- Are approachable, not heavy

Avoid:
- Too specific: "You mentioned work stress..."
- Too deep: "What story are you telling yourself..."
- Too generic: "How are you feeling today?"
- Therapy jargon or intense emotional language

Return ONLY the prompt text. No quotes, no explanation.
